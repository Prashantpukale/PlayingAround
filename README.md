# PlayingAround
This project is a demonstration of memory managment in iOS specially how its done in Objective C.
I will be adding more demo code here to discuss how arc works and how properties in objective C are used along with memory managment symantics.
The current code is ment to demonstrate how atomicity works with properties, manipulating variable from multiple threads in case of 
nonatomic property can cause the var to be corrupted at some point in time.
